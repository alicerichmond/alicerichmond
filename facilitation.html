				<p>Without the proper attention a workshop can be arduous or have low participant contribution. I utilise gamification, learning design and collaborative workshopping techniques for both remote and in person sessions. This allows a much more equal distribution of power, greater conversation and more productive workshops. </p>

				<p>I design and lead immersive inception sessions, UX workshops, stakeholder workshops, service blueprinting sessions and many more. </p>
